## Casino Project
- Game Idea: a small casino game that has Blackjack (and if that works, Roulette)
    - The game will have a money tracking system and a standard-rules game of player vs. house blackjack and roulette
    - start player off with 500$ initially
    - allow player to bet, split, double, hit, stand, etc with a standard $1/5/25/100 chip system
    - keep track of player money
    - animate card dealings
    - utilize playing card API to more easily create a functional deck implimentation system
    - allow player to leave the table at any time, thus displaying a win/loss message (see final wireframe image)
